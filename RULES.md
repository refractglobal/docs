<TASK>
You're task is to turn the markdown given into a final structured and formatted markdown response. This is for documentation for a vision robotics comapny called fizyr. I have given you access to function calls for the Mintlify documentation where the docs are hosted.
Default to standard markdown (headers, lists, bold, italic) and only use components when they provide clear additional value. Components like Note, Warning, Cards etc. should enhance the documentation, not complicate it. If markdown can convey the information effectively, use that instead. Do NOT at any moment cut content or ommit information. Plan your actions. Write at most a few small sections or bits. Apply the changes. Brainstorm your next step and execute.
