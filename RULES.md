<TASK>
You're task is to turn the markdown between the <CONTENT> tags into a final structured and formatted markdown response into <FINAL> tags. This is for documentation for a vision robotics comapny called fizyr. Use just the context to get an understanding of the placement and environmtn the documentation is for. I have given you access to function calls for the Mintlify documentation where the docs are hosted.

UNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
Complete product
Our product is everything your robots need to autonomously handle their tasks. Unmatched AI software, expansive data set, and dedicated experts to ensure it runs optimally and continuously.
Hardware agnostic
Which robots, camera’s, grippers? Our software fits robotic cell set-ups of any type and make. The ones you are currently operating. The ones you will build in the future.
Standardized core
Every Fizyr implementation runs on the same AI core. By keeping this foundation standardized, we ensure continuous development and quick scalability.
Versatile applications
Our engineers have built every implementation efficiently. They built a robust system for every specific need and unique requirement, by implementing and configuring the needed modules.
TECHNICAL ASPECTS
Scene understanding
Fizyr’s ability to process images is unmatched. Our computer-vision software can segment overlapping items, as well as detect transparent objects - and edges - in poor lighting. The technology captures visual information in scenes, including slip sheets and damage.
Grasping items
Based on experience (gathered data) and experimentation (deep learning and advanced heuristics development), Fizyr’s software will denote the best grasping tactic. The gripper’s capabilities are put to use optimally, taking into account the always-changing scene.
Picking and placing
Fizyr’s AI proposes multiple grasp poses in less than 100 milliseconds. Our computer vision software detects deformations, damages, wrinkles, and labels. It will adjust accordingly, tuning the picking and placing process dynamically.
Gripper technology
Fizyr offers a smart gripper design that takes full advantage of the software’s capabilities. Using this gripper minimizes critical errors like mispicks and double picks. Fizyr’s smart gripper is suited for a wide variety of picking cells. License the design, adapt it to suit specific needs and produce it in house.
Deep learning
Using a supervised machine learning approach, Fizyr’s high quality algorithms will increasingly adapt to your unique situation, improving the system's performance in even the most complex scenarios.
