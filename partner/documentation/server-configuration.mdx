## Overview

Fizyr's server infrastructure consists of several specialized components:

- **Detection Server**: Handles object detection and pose estimation
- **Picking Server**: Manages pick point generation and grasp planning
- **Placement Verification Server**: Verifies successful object placement

Each server can be configured independently to optimize performance for specific use cases and hardware configurations.

## General Configuration Principles

When configuring any Fizyr server, consider these key aspects:

1. **Hardware Resources**: Ensure proper GPU/CPU allocation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Balance accuracy and speed
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate pre-trained models
4. **System Integration**: Configure network and communication settings

Let's explore the configuration options for each server component in detail.

## Detection Server Configuration

The Detection Server is responsible for processing images and detecting objects using neural networks. Here's how to configure its key parameters:

### Model Configuration

#### Model Path

Specify the path to your pre-trained model weights:

```yaml
model_path: /etc/fizyr/weights/general_binpick_1.0.0.pt
```

This path should point to your neural network weights file. Ensure the model file exists and has the correct permissions.

#### Confidence Threshold

Set the minimum confidence score for valid detections:

```yaml
score_threshold: 0.75
```

The `score_threshold` determines which detections are considered valid:

- Higher values (e.g., 0.75) result in fewer but more confident detections
- Lower values increase detection count but may include more false positives

### Hardware Settings

#### GPU Selection

Choose which GPU to use for inference:

```yaml
gpu: 0
```

Available options:

- `0` to `n`: Use specific GPU by index
- `-1`: Use CPU instead of GPU

#### Precision Settings

Configure the model's numerical precision:

```yaml
half_precision: false
```

This setting affects model performance and resource usage:

- `true`: Reduces memory usage but may slightly decrease accuracy
- `false`: Uses full precision for maximum accuracy

### Best Practices

When configuring the Detection Server:

1. **Model Selection**: Choose models trained on similar objects to your use case
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Start with a high confidence threshold (0.75) and adjust based on results
3. **Resource Allocation**: Dedicate a GPU to the Detection Server when possible
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep model weights updated with the latest versions

## Picking Server Configuration

The Picking Server manages pick point generation and grasp planning, integrating various components for optimal pick success. Here are the key configuration areas:

### Core Components

The picking server configuration is divided into several key areas:

1. **General Settings**: Basic server configuration
2. **Container Detection**: Settings for bin and container recognition
3. **Detection Filters**: Rules for filtering and processing detections
4. **Detection Prioritization**: Configuration for pick order optimization
5. **Region/Volume of Interest**: Spatial constraints for picking operations
6. **Collision Prevention**: Wall and obstacle avoidance settings

### Configuration Structure

Each component has its own configuration section in the server configuration file. Here's an overview of the main sections:

```yaml
picking_server:
  # General server settings
  general:
    tcp_bind: "[::]:5000"
    log_directory: "/var/log/fizyr/picking"

  # Container detection settings
  container:
    enabled: true
    detection_threshold: 0.8

  # Region of Interest configuration
  roi:
    enabled: true
    margin: 50 # mm

  # Volume of Interest settings
  voi:
    min_height: 0
    max_height: 500 # mm
```

### Best Practices

For optimal picking server performance:

1. **Configuration Validation**: Test settings in a staging environment first
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly review pick success rates
3. **Safety First**: Configure appropriate collision prevention settings
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated to latest compatible versions

The following components can be configured in detail:

- Collision Walls
- Container Detection
- Detection Filters
- Detection Prioritization
- Region of Interest
- Volume of Interest

## Placement Verification Server Configuration

The Placement Verification Server validates successful object placement operations. Most configuration options are set during runtime requests, but some core settings need to be configured in the server configuration file.

### Network Configuration

Configure the server's network binding:

```yaml
tcp:
  bind: "[::]:1234"
```

This setting determines:

- The network interface to listen on
- The port number for incoming connections
- IPv6 compatibility (using `[::]`)

### Logging Configuration

Configure image logging and storage:

```yaml
log:
  directory: /srv/logs/placement-verification
  save_images: true
```

These settings control:

- **directory**: Location for storing verification logs and images
- **save_images**: Enable/disable image storage for verification results

### Runtime Configuration

Most operational parameters are configured during API requests, including:

- Verification thresholds
- Region of interest
- Validation criteria

### Best Practices

For optimal placement verification:

1. **Storage Planning**: Ensure sufficient disk space for image logging
2. **Network Access**: Configure firewall rules to allow required connections
3. **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to manage storage usage
4. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of verification results and storage usage
