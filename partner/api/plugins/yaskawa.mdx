## Overview

Fizyr and Yaskawa have developed the MotoFiz plugin, an expansion module for the MotoPlus SDK. This plugin enables seamless integration between Fizyr's vision system and Yaskawa's MOTOMAN robot controllers.

### What is MotoFiz?

MotoFiz is a specialized expansion module built on top of Yaskawa's MotoPlus SDK. It serves as a bridge between Fizyr's advanced vision capabilities and MOTOMAN controllers, enabling:

- Direct communication between the robot and vision system
- Automated pick and place operations
- Real-time vision feedback
- Advanced calibration features

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing and configuring the MotoFiz plugin on your YRC controller.

# MotoFiz Overview

MotoFiz is an expansion module developed using the MotoPlus SDK, a software development kit from Yaskawa designed for creating modules (MotoPlus apps) for MOTOMAN controllers..

The following pages provide instructions for installing and configuring the MotoFiz module.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before installing the MotoFiz plugin, ensure you have:

- Access to the YRC controller
- USB drive for file transfer
- Required MotoFiz application files
- Appropriate permissions to modify controller settings

## Step 1: Enable MotoPlus

Follow the official Yaskawa guide to enable MotoPlus on your controller:
[Enable MotoPlus Guide](https://knowledge.motoman.com/hc/en-us/articles/13087433828631-How-to-Enable-MotoPlus)

## Step 2: Install MotoPlus Application

Follow the official Yaskawa guide to load the MotoPlus application:
[Loading MotoPlus Application Guide](https://knowledge.motoman.com/hc/en-us/articles/16423922780311-Loading-a-MotoPlus-Application-to-the-Controller)

## Step 3: Load Robot Files

After installing the MotoPlus application, load the robot files using the "External Memory" function:

1. Copy all required files to a USB drive
2. Boot the controller in ONLINE mode (not maintenance)
3. Navigate to the "External Memory" menu and select "Load"
4. Load all files from the USB drive
5. Open the MOTOFIZ_CONFIG file under JOB > SELECT JOB
6. Configure the connection information as described in the Usage document
7. Run the MOTOFIZ_CONFIG job to apply the configurations

> **Warning**: Ensure the controller is in ONLINE mode before proceeding with file loading. Loading files in maintenance mode may result in incomplete installation.

# Configuration

## Overview

The MotoFiz application is configured through a specific inform job file named `MOTOFIZ_CONFIG.JBI`. This file contains configuration parameters stored as comments with unique identifiers.

> **Note**: The configuration file is loaded when the robot boots and can be reloaded at any time using the "Reload Configs" command. Most parameters update immediately, but changes to "CriticalTasks" require a controller reboot.

## General Configuration Parameters

The following parameters control the basic behavior of the MotoFiz application:

## Result Management

### Weight Configuration

Weight values determine how much influence different factors have on the final ranking order:

- `1.0`: No modification to original value
- `0.0`: Value has no influence
- Values between 0 and 1: Proportionally decrease the value's significance

### Min & Max Values

These properties normalize values for computing the final ranking order. Values outside the defined ranges may cause incorrect computations.

> **Warning**: Ensure all detected values fall within the defined min/max ranges to avoid ranking computation errors.

### Robot Variable Options

When `EnableVariableParams` is set to "true", options are read from robot variables starting at the address specified by `StartVarAddress`. Parameters are reloaded each time new detection results are written.

Example variable mapping (starting at address 100):

| Variable | Option           | Note                                                             |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B100     | EnableSorting    | Any non-zero value will result in the option being set to "true" |
| R100     | MinAcceptedScore |                                                                  |
| R113     | AreaWeight       |                                                                  |

## MotoPlus Tasks

> **Note**: This section is for informational purposes only. Configuration of these parameters requires Yaskawa technical support.

The application uses multiple MotoPlus tasks:

- Total tasks used: 4
- Maximum Critical Priority tasks: 3

If you encounter alarm 8090 [1] "FAILED TO CREATE 'XXX' TASK", the following parameters may need adjustment:

| Parameter | Value | Description                                 |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| S1D306    | 3     | Number of available Critical Priority tasks |
| S1D307    | 8     | Total number of available MotoPlus tasks    |

# IO Signals and Registers

## IO Signals Overview

The MotoFiz application uses various IO signals to communicate the state of the system and control operations. These signals are organized into the following categories:

> **Note**: Logging features should be disabled during production operations as they may impact time-sensitive operations.

### Signal Categories

1. **Feedback Signals**: Indicate the state of the MotoPlus application
2. **Control Signals**: Used for triggering commands and logging features
3. **Server Signals**: Show the connection and state of each Fizyr server

### Region Definition

Regions are defined by polygon points in the camera's 2D image space:

> **Note**: Regions must have 3-15 points. Points are defined by X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinates based on camera resolution.

Example of a 1920x1080 rectangular region:

| Address | Value | Point | Coordinate |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| 100     | 4     | Count | -          |
| 101     | 0     | 0     | X          |
| 102     | 0     | 0     | Y          |
| 103     | 0     | 1     | X          |
| 104     | 1080  | 1     | Y          |
| 105     | 1920  | 2     | X          |
| 106     | 1080  | 2     | Y          |
| 107     | 1920  | 3     | X          |
| 108     | 0     | 3     | Y          |

### Input Variables

#### Region / Region of Interest:

The region input data is defined by the count of points in the polygon followed by the associated X and Y coordinates for each point of the polygon. These regions define a space within the camera's 2D image space. The data is based on the available pixel resolution of the camera, where "X" is the horizontal axis (width) and "Y" is the vertical axis (height) or the image. The example below, defines a rectangle region of 1920x1080 starting in the upper left corner \[0, 0].

**Note:** The minimum number of points is 3 to form a proper polygon and the maximum supported amount is **15 points**.

| 100 | 4    | Count of points in the region polygon |                |
| --- | ---- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
|     |      | **Point Index**                       | **Coordinate** |
| 101 | 0    | 0                                     | X              |
| 102 | 0    | 0                                     | Y              |
| 103 | 0    | 1                                     | X              |
| 104 | 1080 | 1                                     | Y              |
| 105 | 1920 | 2                                     | X              |
| 106 | 1080 | 2                                     | Y              |
| 107 | 1920 | 3                                     | X              |
| 108 | 0    | 3                                     | Y              |

### Output Variables

#### Placement Verification Results

The results of the verification processing. Determining the number of objects present within either the full camera field of view or a defined region. Additionally, a success/failure status is applied if a defined or predefined region is specified.

| 100 | Number of detected objects.                            |                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 101 | Determines if the _Check Preset_ result value is valid | 0=invalid 1=valid  |
| 102 | Determines if the _Check Region_ result value is valid | 0=invalid 1=valid  |
| 103 | The success status of the _Check Preset_ results       | 0=failed 1=success |
| 104 | The success status of the _Check Region_ results       | 0=failed 1=success |

### Object Descriptors

During detection, each object is analyzed and classified into three categories:

1. Shape
2. Material
3. Occlusion

These descriptors are stored in R-variables in the order listed above. The index values help identify which R-Variable corresponds to each descriptor and what the "Max descriptor index" refers to.

#### Shape Classifications

| Index | Type     |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | Box      |
| 1     | Bag      |
| 2     | Envelope |
| 3     | Cylinder |
| 4     | Other    |

#### Material Classifications

| Index | Type         |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 0     | Cardboard    |
| 1     | Paper        |
| 2     | Soft Plastic |
| 3     | Hard Plastic |
| 4     | Metal        |
| 5     | Glass        |
| 6     | Other        |

#### Occlusion Classifications

| Index | Type       |
| ----- | ---------- |
