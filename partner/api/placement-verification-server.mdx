## Integer Types

All integers are encoded as little-endian. Signed integers are encoded as two's complement.

<ResponseField name="bool" type="1 byte">
  Boolean value: `false` is encoded as `0`, `true` is encoded as `1`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="u8" type="1 byte">
  Unsigned 8-bit integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="u16" type="2 bytes">
  Unsigned 16-bit integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="u32" type="4 bytes">
  Unsigned 32-bit integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="u64" type="8 bytes">
  Unsigned 64-bit integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="i8" type="1 byte">
  Signed 8-bit two's complement integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="i16" type="2 bytes">
  Signed 16-bit two's complement integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="i32" type="4 bytes">
  Signed 32-bit two's complement integer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="i64" type="8 bytes">
  Signed 64-bit two's complement integer.
</ResponseField>

## Data Structures

### List(T)

Lists are encoded as the number of elements as `u32`, followed by each element.

<ResponseField name="length" type="u32" required>
  The number of elements in the list: `n`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="elements" type="T[]" required>
  Array of `n` elements, each of size `sizeof(T)` bytes.
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  The size of `T` may be variable itself. The size of a `List` is always 4 bytes
  plus the sum of the size of all elements.
</Note>

### Option(T)

Options are encoded as a bool that indicates if the `Option` contains a value, potentially followed by the actual value.

<ResponseField name="has_value" type="bool" required>
  Flag to indicate if the option contains a value.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" type="T">
  The value. Only present if `has_value` is `true`.
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  The size of `T` may be variable itself. The size of an `Option` with a value
  is always 1 byte plus the size of the wrapped value.
</Note>

### String

Strings are encoded as the number of bytes as `u32`, followed by the raw string data.

<ResponseField name="length" type="u32" required>
  The number of bytes in the string (`n`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bytes" type="u8[]" required>
  Array of `n` bytes representing the string data.
</ResponseField>

## Camera State

The `CameraState` enum represents the current state of the camera.

<ResponseField name="Busy" type="u8 = 1">
  The camera is busy. You should assume the camera is busy from the moment you
  send a request until you receive a `CameraState` update, as there will always
  be some latency before the `Busy` update arrives.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Free" type="u8 = 2">
  The camera is free.
</ResponseField>

## Request and Response Types

### CheckRegion

The body of the CheckRegion request extension.

<ResponseField name="min_objects" type="u32" required>
  The minimum acceptable number of objects to be found in the provided region.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_objects" type="u32" required>
  The maximum acceptable number of objects to be found in the provided region.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="polygon" type="List<Point2>" required>
  The region provided as a list of points in polygon order.
</ResponseField>

### CheckResult

The result of the CheckPreset operation.

<ResponseField name="success" type="bool" required>
  True if the objects detected match the preset configuration, and False
  otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="reason" type="string">
  If `success` is False, this will give the reason for failure. If `success` is
  True, this will be empty.
</ResponseField>

### Point2

A 2D point in pixel coordinates with reference to the top left corner of the image.

<ResponseField name="x" type="u32" required>
  The x coordinate in pixel coordinates with respect to the top left corner of
  the image.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="y" type="u32" required>
  The y coordinate in pixel coordinates with respect to the top left corner of
  the image.
</ResponseField>

## Protocol Extensions

### VerifyRequestExtension

An extension to a verify request.

<Note>
  This structured enum is serialized as a 32 bit variant tag, 32 bit variant
  size and the variant body.
</Note>

<ResponseField name="CameraUpdates" type="tag=0, size=0">
  Request updates regarding the state of the camera.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ObjectCount" type="tag=1, size=0">
  Request the number of objects found in the image.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="CheckPreset" type="tag=2, size=4, body=u32">
  Request that the objects in frame be compared to a preset from the
  configuration file.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="RegionOfInterest"
  type="tag=3, size=variable, body=List<Point2>"
>
  Request to only consider objects within a region of interest when performing
  image analysis.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="CheckRegion" type="tag=4, size=variable, body=CheckRegion">
  Request to count the number of objects in a region and compare it to the
  provided range.
</ResponseField>

### VerifyResponseExtension

An extension to a verify response.

<Note>
  The CameraUpdates and RegionOfInterest requests do not have equivalent
  response messages. The CameraUpdates are sent as updates, not responses. The
  RegionOfInterest will impact the behavior of the server, but will not change
  the response or update structure.
</Note>

<ResponseField name="ObjectCount" type="tag=1, size=4, body=u32">
  The number of objects detected in the image (or inside the region of interest,
  if the extension is enabled).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="CheckPreset" type="tag=2, size=variable, body=CheckResult">
  The result of CheckPreset (limited to objects in the region of interest, if
  the extension is enabled).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="CheckRegion" type="tag=4, size=variable, body=CheckResult">
  The result of CheckRegion (limited to objects in the region of interest, if
  the extension is enabled).
</ResponseField>
